# Getting and Cleaning Data Project
Author - Ameya Kulkarni\n
Refered Dataset - [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

## Description
One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example [this article](http://www.insideactivitytracking.com/data-science-activity-tracking-and-the-battle-for-the-worlds-top-sports-brand/). 
Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. 
The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

## Goal of the Project
You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Final Outcomes
- `CodeBook.md` a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data
- `run_analysis.R` Performs the data preparation and cleaning as per the requirements described in **'Goal of the Project'**
- `TidyDataSet.txt` is the final data set which contains data as per the requirements
